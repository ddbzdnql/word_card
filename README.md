word_card_web_application

An application that builds virtual word cards.

################################Very easy to use therefore not much intro is needed###############################

right upper side is the box for adding word.
right middle side shows the statistic of current word_list:
  total words
  learnt words
  unlearnt words
right lower side shows the page separation because every page holds 30 words and the total number might access that.

the middle part are the word cards generated from the words saved in local database.
  click on the sole-word-side will flip the card to complete-definition-side, another click will flip back
  on complete-definition side, mark button will mark the word back and forth between leanred and not learned
    unlearned words will have red as background color and different image bg for the sole-word-side
    
######################################As I said, not so much to be explained######################################
